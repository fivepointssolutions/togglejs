toggle.js

dependencies: prototype.js, lowpro.js, effect.js

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

A LowPro and Prototype-based library with a collection of behaviors for
unobtrusively toggling the visibility of other elements via links,
checkboxes, radio buttons, and selects.

To use you will need to install the following LowPro behaviors. If you are 
using Rails, put this in "application.js":

  Event.addBehavior({
    'a.toggle': Toggle.LinkBehavior(),
    'input.checkbox.toggle': Toggle.CheckboxBehavior(),
    'div.radio_group.toggle': Toggle.RadioGroupBehavior(),
    'select.toggle': Toggle.SelectBehavior()
  });

Once the hooks are installed correctly, you should add a "rel" attribute
to each element that you want to use as a toggle trigger. Set the value
of the "rel" attribute to "toggle[id]" where id is equal to the ID of
the element that you want to toggle. You can toggle multiple elements by 
separating the IDs with commas (like this: "toggle[id1,id2,id3]").

For example, a link with a class of "toggle":

  <a class="toggle" href="#more" rel="toggle[more]">More</a>

will become a trigger for a div with an ID of "more". Checkboxes work in
the exact same manner. To use with a group of radio buttons, make sure
that all of the radio buttons are inside of a div with a class of
"radio_group toggle". Then set the "rel" attribute on each radio button
that should act as a toggle trigger. Selects work in a similar manner,
but the "rel" attribute should be set on each of the option elements that
should toggle the visibility of an element or array of elements.

Each of the included LowPro behaviors can be customized in various ways.
